# Project Title:
Customer Profiling and Product Recommendation for AeroFit Treadmills Using Descriptive Analytics and Hypothesis Testing

# Problem Statement:
AeroFit, a leading fitness equipment brand, aims to identify the characteristics of its target audience for each type of treadmill (KP281, KP481, and KP781). The goal is to provide better product recommendations for new customers based on customer profiles. The analysis focuses on customer demographics, product usage, and fitness levels, while investigating whether significant differences exist across treadmill products with respect to customer characteristics.

The company collected the data on individuals who purchased a treadmill from the AeroFit stores during the prior three months. The dataset has the following features:
Product Purchased: 	KP281, KP481, or KP781
Age: 	In years
Gender: 	Male/Female
Education: 	In years
MaritalStatus: 	Single or partnered
Usage: 	The average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week.
Income: 	Annual income (in $)
Fitness: 	Self-rated fitness on a 1-to-5 scale, where 1 is the poor shape and 5 is the excellent shape.
Miles: 	The average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week

# Approach:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze customer demographics (age, gender, income, education, marital status) and treadmill usage metrics (fitness level, weekly usage, expected miles).
- Descriptive Analytics: Use charts (countplots, histograms, boxplots) to visualize relationships between variables and detect trends.
- Hypothesis Testing: Apply hypothesis testing to determine if customer characteristics (e.g., age, gender, marital status) significantly impact the choice of treadmill.
- Probability Analysis: Construct two-way contingency tables, compute marginal and conditional probabilities for product purchases.
- Correlation Analysis: Assess relationships among variables using heatmaps and pairplots.
- Customer Profiling: Create customer profiles based on key characteristics to assist in product recommendations.

# Potential Impact:
The analysis provides insights into the distinct customer segments for each treadmill, helping AeroFit optimize its marketing strategies, improve customer targeting, and enhance product recommendations. Additionally, understanding how customer demographics and fitness levels influence product choice allows AeroFit to make data-driven decisions to increase sales and customer satisfaction.
